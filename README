## About

Short description: Dualout-Video is a C project that appears to deal with video output/processing. The repository currently lacks a formal project description — please update this section with the project's scope, goals, and high-level architecture.

## Status

- Language: C
- Default branch: `main`
- Last activity: December 2025 (pushed at 2025-12-07T17:25:44Z)
- Issues: None open at time of writing

## Requirements

These are typical requirements for a C project. Adjust as needed:
- GCC or Clang (or your preferred C compiler)
- Make (if a Makefile is provided)
- Any platform-specific libraries or SDKs used by this project (list them here once known)

## Build

If a `Makefile` exists:
```bash
make
```

If there is no Makefile, a simple compile command (example) might be:
```bash
gcc -o dualout main.c -I./include -L./lib -lm
```

Replace `main.c`, include and library paths as appropriate for this repo. If the project targets embedded hardware or uses a cross-compiler, include cross-build instructions and toolchain setup here.

## Usage

Add runtime examples and usage patterns here. Example (placeholder):
```bash
./dualout [options]
# or
./dualout input-file output-file
```

Document command-line options, configuration files, environment variables, and any runtime dependencies.

## Repository layout

Update this section to reflect the actual layout. Example structure:
- `src/` — source C files
- `include/` — public headers
- `lib/` — third-party libraries
- `tests/` — unit or integration tests
- `docs/` — documentation and design notes
- `examples/` — usage examples

Replace with the real directories present in this repository.
